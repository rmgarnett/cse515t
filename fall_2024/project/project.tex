{\large \textbf{CSE 515T (Fall 2024) Project}} \\

A portion of your grade this semester will be based on a significant project
investigating Bayesian methods in depth. You will have two possible paths to
satisfy this project requirement.

The main goal of the project is to give you hands-on experience applying
Bayesian methods to a real-world dataset.  The use of real-world data can have
many interesting (and potentially frustrating!) aspects that are difficult to
convey without getting your hands dirty.  The scope of the project is intended
to be more than a homework problem, but less than a full-fledged research paper.

Note that I don't necessarily expect your idea to ``work.''  Part of research is
trying out ideas, regardless of whether they're ultimately successful.  If your
idea does ``work,'' I expect you to think about why it was succesful.  If not, I
expect you to think about why not!

\section*{Option 1: Novel project with existing data}

Some of you may be working on existing projects or be an expert in relevant data
where the techniques of this class could be brought to bear; for example if you
are a Ph.D.\ student wishing to analyze existing data, or if you have a hobbyist
interest in and passion for some particular dataset. In previous semesters,
several students have used the project as a springboard for investigations that
eventually lead to publications.

If this is the case you may propose a project applying Bayesian techniques to
your problem. There is a great deal of freedom in defining this project to suit
your needs. However, a critical requirement to this option is that \emph{you be
  an expert in the data you are proposing.} In particular, the following
datasets are \emph{insufficient:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kaggle competitions, etc.
\item reference datasets from machine learning, \acro{UCI} datasets, etc.
\end{itemize}

However, in previous semesters I have seen people use data from surprising
sources that lead to interesting projects! Examples from previous semesters
include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Split times from cross country races, with the goal of predicting a
  runner's performance from their previous races.
\item Several projects on predicting sports outcomes from various features,
  predicting tournament outcomes, etc.
\item
  A Bayesian ray tracer based on Bayesian quadrature.
\end{itemize}
As you can see, you can be passionate about and an expert in data that is not
academic/scientific!

If you wish to pursue this route, your project will comprise four parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A one-page proposal outlining the problem you want to solve, its importance
  and motivation, your proposed solution, and the data will use for your
  investigation. This will be due \textbf{Monday, 4 November 2024} (no
  extensions). We will review your proposal and give you feedback.  At this
  stage we may also \emph{reject} your proposal if we feel the problem is not
  appropriate.
\item
  A two-page status report reporting on your current progress and detailing any
  issues/questions you may have, due \textbf{Friday, 22 November 2024} (no
  extensions).  We will provide feedback and guidance.
\item
  A four-page final report detailing the final approach and the outcomes of the
  investigation, due \textbf{Thursday, 12 December 2024} (no extensions).
\item
  A ten-minute presentation to the class during the \textbf{last week of class.}
\end{itemize}

This project option can optionally have teams of 2--4 people; however at least
50\% of the team members must rise to the level of ``experts'' on the
data. Please comment on this in your proposal.

\clearpage

\section*{Option 2: Supervised project}

If you do not wish to pursue the first project option, you can instead complete
a guided project incorporating many notions from this class following the
outline below. There is still considerable room for creativity in this option.

You can work in teams of 2--3 on this project if you desire.

The project will be an investigation into applying Bayesian optimization to
automatic and efficient hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models.

We will use two sources of data for this investigation. The first is a classical
synthetic benchmark function used in optimization, the \emph{Goldstein--Price}
function.  See here for a description, formula, and some implementations:
\begin{quote}
  \url{https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/goldpr.html}
\end{quote}
This is a function of a two-dimensional input and can be useful for visualizing
the behavior of the methods you will implement. The goal is to minimize the
function over the specified box-bounded domain (defined on the page above).

The second is real data from a hyperparameter tuning task on two different
models: \acro{SVM} and online \acro{LDA}. These datasets were used in the paper
``Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms'' by Snoek, et
al. The paper is available at
\begin{quote}
  \url{http://tiny.cc/bopt}
\end{quote}
You should read it!

Given some data, the performance of each methods was evaluated on a
three-dimensional grid of hyperparameter values, defining an objective function
$f(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is a three-dimensional hyperparameter vector. Our
goal is to maximize the performance of the model as a function of the
hyperparameters.  As the cost of training and evaluating the performance of
these models is so great, we will use the precomputed grids instead. The data is
available here:
\begin{quote}
  \url{https://github.com/mwhoffman/benchfunk/tree/master/benchfunk/functions/data}
\end{quote}
For each problem, the goal is to minimize the value in the fourth column given
the values of the hyperparameters in the first three. You can ignore the final
column.

Note that all of these are \emph{minimization} problems.

The project will comprise a series of smaller components that you must
complete. You will then compile your findings into a report. I expect every
bulleted item to be addressed in the report. The report will be due
\textbf{Wednesday, 6 December 2024} (no extensions), the last day of class.

If you have any question about what may or may not be appropriate for any of
these parts, please feel free to ask on Slack!

\subsection*{Data visualization}

First let's do some visualization of the data to get some insight into the
functions we are dealing with.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Make a heatmap of the value of the Goldstein--Price function over the domain $\mc{X} =
  [-2, 2] \times [-2, 2]$ using a dense grid of values, with 1000 values per
  dimension, forming a $1000 \times 1000$ image.
\item
  Describe the behavior of the function. Does it appear \emph{stationary?} (That
  is, does the behavior of the function appear to be relatively constant
  throughout the domain?)
\item Can you find a transformation of the data that makes it more stationary?
\item
  Make a kernel density estimate of the distribution of the values for the
  \acro{LDA} and \acro{SVM} benchmarks. Interpret the distributions.
\item
  Again, can you find a transformation that makes the performance better
  behaved?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model fitting}

Before we can succeed with optimization, we must first determine whether we can
build a useful model of the objective function. If we can't find an informative
model that can make reasonable predictions, it would be foolish to try to use
the model to make decisions.

We begin with the Goldstein--Price function where we can make useful diagnostic plots. For
this first series of steps, do not apply any transformation to the outputs of
the function; use its output directly.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Select a set of 32 training points for the Goldstein--Price function in the domain
  $\mc{X} = [-2, 2] \times [-2, 2]$ using a \emph{Sobol sequence.} This is a
  so-called low-discrepancy sequence that produces ``quasirandom'' points that
  fill the space relatively evenly; see the Wikipedia article for more
  information, and note that this should be built into most scientific
  software. Measure the function at these locations to form a dataset $\data$.
\item
  Fit a Gaussian process model to the data using a constant mean and a squared
  exponential covariance. As the output of a deterministic computer program,
  there is no ``noise'' in our observations, so we should fix the standard
  deviation of the noise to a small value such as $0.001$. This is possible in
  most \acro{GP} software packages.

  Maximize the marginal likelihood of the data as a function of the
  hyperparameters: constant mean value and the length scale and output scale of
  the covariance function.
\item
  What values did you learn for the hyperparameters? Do they agree with your
  expectations given your visualization?
\item
  Make a heatmap of the Gaussian process posterior mean as you did of the
  function. Compare the predicted values with the true values.  Do you see
  systematic errors?
\item
  Make a heatmap of the Gaussian process posterior standard deviation (not
  variance!) as you did of the function. Do the values make sense? Does the
  scale make sense? Does the standard deviation drop to near zero at your data
  points?

  Note that if these heatmaps do not agree with your intuition, it may indicate
  a bug or mistake somewhere!
\item
  Make a kernel density estimate of the $z$-scores of the residuals between the
  posterior mean of trained Gaussian process and the true values. If the
  Gaussian process model is well calibrated this should be approximately
  standard normal. Is that the case?
\item
  Repeat the above using a log transformation to the output of the Goldstein--Price
  function. Does the marginal likelihood improve? Does the model appear better
  calibrated?
\end{itemize}

Now let's try some different models. Given a \acro{GP} mean function and
covariance, we can derive a score for how well those choices fit a given
dataset, such as the dataset of 32 observations $\data$ above. The most natrual
score would be the model evidence after integrating over the hyperparameters,
but unfortunately this is intractable for Gaussian process models. A widespread
and convenient approximation is called the \emph{Bayesian information criterion}
(\acro{BIC}). Look up the Wikipedia article and read it! To compute the
\acro{BIC} we first find the values of the hyperparameters maximizing the (log)
marginal likelihood:
\[
  \hat{\theta} = \argmax_\theta \log p(y \given X, \theta).
\]
Now the \acro{BIC} is a combination of two terms rewarding model fit and
penalizing model complexity:
\[
\acro{BIC} = \lvert \theta \rvert \log \lvert \data \rvert - 2 \log p(y \given X, \hat{\theta}),
\]
where $\lvert \theta \rvert$ is the total number of hyperparameters (above, 3)
and $\lvert \data \rvert$ is the number of observations (above, 32). Given a set
of models, we prefer the one with the lowest \acro{BIC}, and this score can actually
be interpreted as an approximation to the (negative) log model evidence.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Compute the \acro{BIC} score for the data and model from the last part.
\item
  Considering \acro{BIC} as a function of the choice of mean and covariance
  functions $(\mu, K)$, as well as the dataset described above, attempt a search
  over models to find the best possible explanation of the data. What is the
  best model you found and its \acro{BIC} score? The notion of the
  ``compositional kernel grammar'' may be useful for automating the search, or
  you could do it by hand.  You may also consider transformations of the data to
  improve the \acro{BIC} further.
\item
  Perform a similar search for the \acro{SVM} and \acro{LDA} datasets, using 32
  randomly sampled observations from each dataset.  What is the best \acro{GP}
  model you found for each?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bayesian optimization}

Let's fix a choice of Gaussian process model for each of the datasets above by
selecting the best model (possibly coupled with a transformation) you found, and
for now let's fix the hyperparameters of that model to be those that maximize
the marginal likelihood of the dataset. We will now implement a basic Bayesian
optimization procedure and observe its performance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Implement the \emph{expected improvement} acquisition function (formula in the
  Snoek, et al.\ paper above), which provides a score to each possible
  observation location in light of the observed data. The formula is a function
  of the posterior predictive mean and pointwise variance of a point, which
  should be readily available.

  Be careful as different authors define \acro{EI} for minimization or for
  maximization. We have minimization problems but we can make them maximization
  problems by negating if needed.
\item
  For the Goldstein--Price function, make new heatmaps for the posterior mean
  and standard deviation from the 32 datapoints we used before using the model
  you selected.  Make another heatmap for the \acro{EI} value, and place a mark
  where it is maximized. Does the identified point seem like a good next
  observation location?
\item
  For the Goldstein--Price, \acro{SVM}, and \acro{LDA} functions, implement the
  following experiment:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    select 5 randomly located initial observations, $\data$
  \item
    repeat the following 30 times:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Find the point $x$ that maximizes the expected improvement acquisition
      function given the current data. For the Goldstein--Price function, you
      can simply measure \acro{EI} on a dense grid or on a dense Sobol set and
      find the maximum on that dense set.  For the other datasets, you can
      measure \acro{EI} on the unlabeled points and maximize.
    \item
      Add the observation $\bigl(x, f(x)\bigr)$ to your dataset.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    return the final dataset (containing 35 observations)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We will evaluate performance as follows. Using the final returned dataset,
  identify the best point found. We will score optimization performance using
  the ``gap'' measure, which for maximization is:
  \[
  \text{gap} = \frac{f(\text{best found}) - f(\text{best initial})}{f(\text{maximum}) - f(\text{best initial})}.
  \]
  You can interpret gap is the portion of the ``gap'' between the best initial
  observation among the 5 initial data points and the optimum that we managed to
  traverse over the course of optimization; this gives us a normalized score
  between 0 and 1 for how well we did.
\item
  Now perform 20 runs of the above Bayesian optimization experiment using
  different random initializations, and store the entire sequence of
  observations for each run.

  For a baseline, we will use random search. Using the same initializations,
  implement random search (i.e., a policy that samples an unlabeled point in the
  domain completely at random). Allow random search to have a total budget of
  150 observations rather than 30 (5 times the budget), but store the entire
  sequence of data. This will allow us to compare with na\"ive ``parallel random
  search'' below.
\item
  Make a plot of ``learning curves'' for each of the methods on each of the
  datasets. For now only using the first 30 observations for random search, plot
  the average gap achieved by Bayesian optimization and random search as a
  function of the number of observations for each of the datasets. (That is,
  after 1, 2, \dots 30 observations, we visualize the performance of each
  method.) You'll want to make one plot per dataset with a curve for each
  method, allowing us to see how well each method compares on that dataset.
\item
  What is the mean gap for \acro{EI} and for random search using 30
  observations?  What about 60? 90? 120? 150?  Perform a paired $t$-test (gasp!)
  comparing the performance of random search (using 30 observations) and
  \acro{EI}. What is the $p$-value? How many observations does random search
  need before the $p$ value raises above 0.05? We can interpret the result in
  terms of a ``speedup'' of Bayesian optimization over random search.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bonus}

Finally, for the remainder of the project, take this initial investigation into
a new direction of your choosing. There is considerable flexibility here, and some
examples are below. I obviously don't expect you to do all of these or even any
of these if you have a different idea:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Investigate different objectives or a different task.
\item
  Implement more acquisition functions and compare their performance with
  \acro{EI} and random search as above. There are numerous options out there!
\item
  Investigate how the performance of Bayesian optimization changes if after
  every observation we relearn the model's hyperparameters by maximizing
  the marginal likelihood.
\item
  Investigate batch Bayesian optimization. What if we select multiple points
  at once? There are numerous acquisition functions for implementing such a policy.
\item
  Investigate how Bayesian optimization performs in the face of observation
  noise.  You can simulate this noise by adding random noise with a given
  variance into each observation. Does noise slow us down? How much?
\end{itemize}

Please write a (at-least) one-page report on this final part,
including your idea and your findings.
